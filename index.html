                Govt. Model Degree College, Baghbar, was established in 2023 with the vision of providing accessible and
                quality higher education to the youth of the greater Baghbar region. Prior to the founding of this
                institution, students from Baghbar and its surrounding areas faced significant challenges in pursuing higher
                studies, often traveling distances of up to 50 kilometers to attend colleges in nearby towns. This not only
                placed a physical and financial burden on the students but also limited their educational opportunities.

                With the establishment of this college, the community has gained a much-needed educational hub, ensuring
                that students no longer need to travel long distances to pursue their dreams. The college is dedicated to
                empowering young minds, offering them a space to grow academically, socially, and personally, while
